Purpose

- Provide the stepwise map from the discrete site model to continuum PDEs.
- Establish the RD branch as canonical for first-order time dynamics; quarantine the EFT/KG branch (second-order) for future work.
- Fix nomenclature and parameter mapping reused across derivations and validations.

Assumptions/Parameters

- Lattice spacing a, coordination z (nearest neighbors).
- Coupling J (diffusive exchange scale).
- On-site parameters α, β (logistic).
- Field W_i(t) on sites i; continuum field φ(x,t) after coarse-graining.
- Units: time step τ_u, length a; RD uses first-order ∂t φ; EFT uses second-order ∂t² φ with c² from the discrete action.

Discrete law (nearest-neighbor, logistic on-site)

- Site ODE:
  dW_i/dt = (α − β) W_i − α W_i^2 + J Σ_{j∈nbr(i)} (W_j − W_i)
- Notes:
  - The exchange term preserves the lattice mean; signs ensure diffusion-like smoothing.
  - For small amplitude about W ≈ 0, the kinetics are linearized by dropping −α W_i^2.

Continuum limit (stepwise)

1) Coarse-grain W_i → φ(x,t) with x on a regular lattice, spacing a.
2) Write the discrete Laplacian in central-difference form and expand:
   Σ_{j∈nbr(i)} (W_j − W_i) = a² ∇²φ + O(a⁴ ∇⁴φ)
3) Identify the continuum parameters:
   - Diffusion: D = J a² (site Laplacian) or D = (J/z) a² (neighbor-average form)
   - Growth and saturation: r = α − β, u = α
4) Leading-order RD PDE (canonical):
   ∂t φ = D ∇²φ + r φ − u φ²

PDE/Action/Potential branches

- RD branch [PROVEN, canonical]:
  - ∂t φ = D ∇²φ + r φ − u φ² with D = J a² (or (J/z) a²), r = α − β, u = α.
  - Closest discrete check: linear growth/dispersion and Fisher–KPP pulled-front speed.
- EFT/KG branch [PLAUSIBLE, quarantined]:
  - Second-order time with action-derived kinetic normalization:
    ∂t² φ + γ ∂t φ − c² ∇² φ + V′(φ) = 0, with c² = 2 J a² (per-site) or c² = κ a², κ=2J (per-edge).
  - Mass parameter follows m_eff² = V″(v) at the vacuum v; not used in RD validations.

Fixed points & stability (RD)

- Homogeneous fixed points: φ=0 and φ* = r/u (for r>0, φ*>0).
- Linear stability:
  - Around φ=0: σ = r − D k² (unstable for small k if r>0).
  - Around φ*: σ = −r − D k² < 0 for r>0 (stable).

Dispersion relations

- Continuum RD (Fourier mode k): σ(k) = r − D k². [PROVEN]
- Discrete lattice (mode index m on N sites, periodic):
  σ_d(m) = r − (4D/dx²) sin²(π m/N) with dx = L/N. Small-k expansion recovers σ ≈ r − D k². [PROVEN]
- See validation script: [rd_dispersion_experiment.py](Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/code/physics/reaction_diffusion/rd_dispersion_experiment.py:1) and doc [rd_dispersion_validation.md](Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/reaction_diffusion/rd_dispersion_validation.md:1).

Front speed (Fisher–KPP)

- Theory: c_front = 2 √(D r). [PROVEN]
- Experiment: [rd_front_speed_experiment.py](Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/code/physics/reaction_diffusion/rd_front_speed_experiment.py:1) and doc [rd_front_speed_validation.md](Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/reaction_diffusion/rd_front_speed_validation.md:1).

Conservation or Lyapunov notes

- Diffusion decreases spatial variance; the reaction term sets carrying capacity φ* = r/u.
- Global positivity is preserved given nonnegative initial data under the canonical discretization. [PLAUSIBLE]
- Noether-style invariants apply to the EFT action, not to the RD dissipative flow; see [symmetry_analysis.md](Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/foundations/symmetry_analysis.md:1) for context. [SCOPE]

Numerical plan + acceptance (recap)

- Grids: N ∈ {1024, 2048}, domain length L≈200; CFL≈0.2.
- Acceptance gates:
  - Front speed: |c_meas − c_th| / c_th ≤ 6% and R² ≥ 0.9999 on the tracked front interval.
  - Dispersion: median relative error ≤ 2×10⁻³ and R²_array ≥ 0.999. 
- Outputs auto-routed to derivation/code/outputs/{figures,logs}/reaction_diffusion with timestamped names.
- See logs referenced in [LOG_20250824.md](Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/DAILY_LOGS/LOG_20250824.md:1).

Units and normalization

- RD: choose units so that D and r have desired scales; rescale x→x/L, t→t/T as needed.
- EFT: keep c² = 2 J a² mapping explicit; units can set c=1 after identification. [REFERENCE]
