# Dark Photon - Quantum Bridge (target set)

**Purpose:** Give immediate, concrete targets that bridge your portal work to quantum credibility, with one artifact per document (figure + CSV). Keep everything plain-English, equation-light.

**Files created by this pack**

- Portal_Lingo.md
- Noise_Budget.md
- Decoherence_Portals.md
- Fisher_Epsilon.md
- EFT_Ladder.md
- noise_budget.csv
- fisher_example.csv

**Rhythm:** For each doc, produce a minimum of one python simulation that outputs **one figure + one CSV/JSON** each, and assert **acceptance gates** before merging.
