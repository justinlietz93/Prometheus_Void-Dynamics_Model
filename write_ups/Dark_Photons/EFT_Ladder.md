# EFT Scale Ladder (what changes as you zoom)
**Goal:** One ladder figure + 5 bullets explaining assumptions at each rung.

## Rungs (edit as needed)

1. **Detector scale** (Hz-GHz): noise model, materials, coherence time.
2. **Portal scale** (m_A′, ε): decay modes, lifetime, production mechanism.
3. **Dark-sector dynamics** (α_D, dark Higgs): in/visible branching, self-interactions.
4. **SM matching** (loops, thresholds): running couplings, radiative mixings.
5. **UV completion** (≫ TeV): what breaks/extends the EFT; symmetries that protect ε.

## Acceptance gates

- [ ] Ladder graphic present.
- [ ] 5 bullets match the rungs; no undefined jargon.
