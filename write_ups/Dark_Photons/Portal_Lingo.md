# Portal → Quantum: Lingo & Mapping

**Goal:** Speak quantum-field basics fluently using your portal (dark photon A′) as the anchor.

## What to say in 60-90s

- Field ↔ particle (ripple ↔ quantum), gauge, mixing (ε as leaky splitter), mass (dark Higgs or Stueckelberg), state & measurement (clicks vs interference).
- Visible vs invisible channels = where the **record** lands (SM vs dark).

## Deliverables

- 1-panel diagram (fields ⇄ quanta ⇄ detectors). *(PNG placeholder now)*
- 1 summary paragraph (≤120 words).

## Acceptance gates

- [ ] Diagram present and legible.
- [ ] Paragraph hits: field, quantum, gauge, mixing, mass, measurement.
