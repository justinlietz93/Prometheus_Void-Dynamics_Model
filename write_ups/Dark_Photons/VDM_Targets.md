Short answer: it was a blend. I started from “what the field usually probes” (so you aren’t chasing phantoms) and then filtered hard through the structure of your Void Dynamics / Voxtrium stack-where energy moves between sectors via a transfer current (J^\nu), where rates split by partitions (p_i) on a simplex, and where late-time injections must stay small. That’s why I emphasized astrophysical/cosmological channels and correlated-drift tests over collider-only ideas: it matches your own bookkeeping.

Here’s the split, explicitly:

### What’s “standard playbook” (any dark-photon program would chase)

* **Beam-dump / fixed-target missing-energy** and **collider invisibles**: model-agnostic ways to see kinetic-mixing portals-good for coverage, not uniquely VDM-ish.
* **Stellar-cooling / SN-1987A bounds**: classic energy-loss arguments that carve out or hint at low-mass, weakly-mixed regimes.

These aren’t tailored to your void picture; they’re the scaffolding every search stands on.

### What I picked because they mesh with your VDM/Voxtrium logic

* **Correlated-drift test**: your framework predicts **rate ratios** when the void “leaks” energy:
  (\dot\rho_{\rm DM}/\dot\rho_\Lambda = p_{\rm DM}/p_\Lambda) during epochs with roughly constant partitions. That co-evolution relation is a crisp, falsifiable VDM signature and pairs naturally with any portal (including a dark photon) that mediates energy between sectors.
* **“Small-source” late-time regime**: you already require the DE drift (\epsilon_{\rm DE}) and the DM injection fraction (f_{\rm inj}) to be tiny at low redshift; that pushes you toward **subtle cosmological footprints** over spectacular lab signals, again pointing to astrophysics/cosmology as the first hunting ground.
* **Causal sourcing with a retarded kernel**: your own causal (K_{\rm ret}) setup naturally matches horizon/astrophysical production stories (BH growth, mergers), not hard on-shell production in colliders. That’s why I leaned into supernovae/compact objects and background-evolution tests.
* **Parameter discipline & “gates”**: your repo culture is to make claims via acceptance gates (tolerances, (R^2))-you’ve done this for RD front speeds and dispersion. So I framed dark-photon targets where the same ethos can be applied (cross-correlations, controlled likelihoods), rather than fishing expeditions.

### A VDM-aligned shortlist (if you want the fastest traction)

1. **Co-evolution ratio search** (background cosmology): fit ({\rho_\Lambda(z),\rho_{\rm DM}(z)}) jointly and test whether deviations obey your partition ratio prediction to first order. This directly operationalizes your (J^\nu) + partitions structure.  
2. **Supernova/compact-object “leak & return”** channels: look for narrow windows where a weakly-mixed vector could be produced and (sometimes) reconvert-tunable to keep (\epsilon_{\rm DE}, f_{\rm inj}) small today while still leaving signatures tied to BH/merger histories, which you already encode as entropy sources.
3. **Epoch-dependent partitions**: your softmax partitions (p_i(z)) (with (z) built from dimensionless micro inputs) give you a clean, testable way to **predict when** energy prefers (\Lambda) vs DM vs GW. That’s leverage for making forecasts other groups aren’t making.  

So: the generic bits keep you honest; the specific bets were chosen because they exploit pieces that are **distinctive to your model**-transfer current bookkeeping, partition ratios, causal sourcing, and your dimensionless-group hygiene-not because “everyone else does them.”

If you want, I’ll turn one of these (e.g., the co-evolution ratio test) into a one-pager with an acceptance-gated analysis plan so it drops straight into your repo alongside the RD validations you’ve already proved out.
