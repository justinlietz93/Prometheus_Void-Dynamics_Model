Purpose

- Show that the framework admits a regime whose macroscopic dynamics obey Navier€“Stokes (NS). Provide:
  1) An operational construction via a kinetic/Lattice€“Boltzmann (LBM) sector that yields NS with identified viscosity.
  2) A structural reduction template from conserved fields, symmetries, and constitutive closure.

Status and Scope

- RD sector remains canonical (validated Fisher€“KPP front speed). Fluids is an additional, scoped sector with its own derivation and benchmarks. Claims are restricted to this file and its benchmarks.

## Part I €” Operational reduction via kinetic/LBM

### I.1 Discrete kinetic model (D2Q9 BGK)

Let f_i(x, t) be particle populations with discrete velocities c_i and weights w_i. One BGK time step (dx = dt = 1 in lattice units):
f_i(x + c_i Δ”t, t + Δ”t) ˆ’ f_i(x, t) = ˆ’(Δ”t/ρ„) [ f_i(x, t) ˆ’ f_i^eq(ρ, v) ].

Macroscopic fields:
ρ = Δ£_i f_i,€ƒρ v = Δ£_i c_i f_i.

Equilibrium (second order in v):
f_i^eq = w_i ρ [ 1 + (c_i·v)/c_s^2 + (c_i·v)^2/(2 c_s^4) ˆ’ v^2/(2 c_s^2) ],
with lattice sound speed c_s fixed by {c_i, w_i} (D2Q9: c_s^2 = 1/3).

Implementation plan

- Module: [lbm2d.py](Prometheus_VDM/write_ups/code/physics/fluid_dynamics/fluids/lbm2d.py:1)
- Supports: periodic boundaries, bounce€‘back no€‘slip walls, simple forcing hook, viscosity Δ½ = c_s^2(ρ„ ˆ’ 1/2).

### I.2 Chapman€“Enskog expansion (sketch)

Introduce small Knudsen Δµ and expand f_i = f_i^(0) + Δµ f_i^(1) + ···, with ˆ‚_t = Δµ ˆ‚_{t1} + Δµ^2 ˆ‚_{t2} and ˆ‡ = Δµ ˆ‡_1.

- O(Δµ): mass and momentum conservation.
- O(Δµ^2): Newtonian viscous stress.
In the incompressible scaling:
ˆ‚_t v + (v·ˆ‡)v = ˆ’ˆ‡p/ρ + Δ½ ˆ‡^2 v + f,€ƒˆ‡·v = 0,
with kinematic viscosity Δ½ = c_s^2 (ρ„ ˆ’ Δ”t/2).

Conclusion

- The kinetic/LBM sector reduces to incompressible NS with explicit Δ½.

## Part II €” Structural reduction from conserved fields

### II.1 Fields and symmetries

Introduce mass density ρ(x, t), momentum g = ρ v (and energy/entropy if thermal). Impose:

- Galilean invariance; spatial isotropy; frame objectivity.
- Local balances:
  ˆ‚_t ρ + ˆ‡·(ρ v) = 0,
  ˆ‚_t g + ˆ‡·(g Š— v) = ˆ’ˆ‡p + ˆ‡·ρ„ + ρ f.

### II.2 Constitutive closure (gradient expansion)

Assume rapid local equilibration †’ Newtonian stress at leading order:
ρ„ = Δ· (ˆ‡v + ˆ‡v^T) + (Δ¶ ˆ’ 2Δ·/3)(ˆ‡·v) I + O(|ˆ‡v|^2).
With isothermal, incompressible closure (ˆ‡·v = 0, ρ = ρ_0), obtain standard NS with Δ½ = Δ·/ρ_0.

### II.3 Parameter identification

From microparameters (e.g., collision time ρ„ in LBM, lattice units) identify:

- Δ½ = c_s^2(ρ„ ˆ’ Δ”t/2) (LBM sector), or
- Δ½ = Δ·/ρ_0 (continuum closure).
Higher€‘order terms become negligible in long€‘time/long€‘wavelength scaling.

Conclusion

- Under hydrodynamic scaling, the conserved€‘field sector reduces to NS.

## Part III €” Benchmarks and Acceptance

Benchmarks

1) Taylor€“Green vortex (2€‘D periodic): energy E(t) = E0 exp(ˆ’2 Δ½ k^2 t). Fit Δ½ from decay and match input Δ½ within threshold.
2) Lid€‘driven cavity: centerline profiles at Re ˆˆ {100, 400, 1000} converge with grid; divergence norm small.
3) Divergence control: report €-ˆ‡·v€-_2 over time; require grid€‘convergent decrease.

Acceptance thresholds (double precision)

- Taylor€“Green: |Δ½_fit ˆ’ Δ½_th| / Δ½_th ‰¤ 5% at baseline grid (‰¥ 256^2).
- Lid€‘driven cavity: max_t €-ˆ‡·v€-_2 ‰¤ 1eˆ’6.
- Convergence under grid refinement consistent with scheme order.
- JSON includes passed boolean, key metrics, figure path, timestamp.

## Relation to the existing RD path

- RD Fisher€“KPP front speed (canonical RD check) remains unchanged; see:
  - Validation: [rd_front_speed_validation.md](reaction_diffusion/rd_front_speed_validation.md:1)
  - Experiment: [rd_front_speed_experiment.py](code/physics/rd_front_speed_experiment.py:1)
- Fluids claims are restricted to this sector and its benchmarks; the sectors live side€‘by€‘side to preserve scope discipline.

Notes

- The RD sector remains canonical; fluids is additive. Public phrasing should reflect that the framework contains a fluids sector that reduces to NS (LBM route) and passes standard benchmarks within stated tolerances.
