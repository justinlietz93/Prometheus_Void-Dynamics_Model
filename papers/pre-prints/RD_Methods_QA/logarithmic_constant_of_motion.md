Abstract
I prove a closed-form constant of motion for the autonomous on-site law
\[
\dot W \;=\; r\,W \;-\; u\,W^2,
\]
which underpins the Reaction-Diffusion (RD) baseline of Void Dynamics. Defining
\[
Q(W,t)\;=\;\ln\!\frac{W}{\,r-uW\,}\;-\;r\,t,
\]
I show that \(\tfrac{d}{dt}Q=0\) along solutions on domains where the expression is defined (e.g., \(0<W<r/u\)). I relate \(Q\) to the standard logistic solution, establish domains/branches and limiting behaviors, and explain why a naïve “kinetic\(+\)potential” energy is not conserved for this first-order dissipative flow. Finally, I include a minimal, self-contained numerical protocol that verifies machine-precision constancy of \(Q\) and exhibits convergence consistent with the time-stepper’s order. The note is self-contained and implementation-agnostic.

1. Introduction and main statement
I consider the one-degree-of-freedom, autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE)
\[
\dot W \;=\; F(W)\;=\; r\,W - u\,W^2,\qquad r,u\in\mathbb{R},
\]
and assume \(u\neq 0\). (In many RD parameterizations one writes \(r=\alpha-\beta\), \(u=\alpha\); I do not need that mapping here.) Because the ODE is autonomous, time-translation symmetry implies the existence of an implicit first integral. The following explicit invariant holds.

Proposition (logarithmic invariant). For any interval on which the expression is defined (e.g., \(0<W<r/u\) when \(r/u>0\)),
\[
Q(W,t)\;\equiv\;\ln\!\frac{W}{\,r-uW\,}\;-\;r\,t
\]
is constant along any trajectory of \(\dot W=rW-uW^2\).

2. Proof (time-translation constant for an autonomous ODE)
For an autonomous ODE \(\dot W=F(W)\), one has \(dt=\tfrac{dW}{F(W)}\). Here
\[
\frac{dW}{F(W)} \;=\; \frac{dW}{W(r-uW)} \;=\; \frac{1}{r}\left(\frac{1}{W}+\frac{u}{\,r-uW\,}\right)dW.
\]
Integrating both sides gives
\[
t + C \;=\; \frac{1}{r}\Big(\ln|W|-\ln|r-uW|\Big),
\]
or equivalently,
\[
\ln\!\frac{W}{\,r-uW\,}\;-\;r\,t \;=\; \text{const}.
\]
Defining \(Q(W,t) \equiv \ln\!\big(\tfrac{W}{r-uW}\big) - r t\) yields \(\tfrac{d}{dt}Q=0\) along solutions. This proves the claim.  
Remark. The proof is valid on any interval avoiding the simple poles at \(W=0\) and \(W=r/u\), with a consistent logarithm branch chosen on that interval.

3. Relation to the logistic closed-form solution
Separation of variables yields the well-known logistic solution
\[
W(t)\;=\;\frac{r}{u}\,\frac{1}{1+C\,e^{-r t}},\qquad
C\;=\;\frac{r-uW_0}{W_0},
\]
for an initial condition \(W(0)=W_0\) that avoids the poles. Substituting into the invariant gives
\[
Q\big(W(t),t\big)
=\ln\!\left(\frac{\tfrac{r}{u}\,\tfrac{1}{1+C e^{-rt}}}{\,r-\tfrac{r}{1+C e^{-rt}}\,}\right)-rt
=\ln\!\left(\frac{1}{u}\cdot\frac{1}{C}\right),
\]
which is constant in time. Thus \(Q\) encodes the integration constant (\(1/C\)) up to an additive constant \(-\ln u\); different branches correspond to the standard piecewise structure induced by the poles.

4. Properties, domains, units, and limits
- Poles and branches. \(Q\) has simple poles at \(W=0\) and \(W=r/u\). On any open interval avoiding these poles, one may select a consistent logarithm branch and obtain a constant \(Q\). Natural intervals are: (i) \((0,r/u)\) when \(r/u>0\), and (ii) \((r/u,\infty)\) when \(r/u>0\). Similar partitions apply when \(r/u<0\).
- Units. If \(W\) is dimensionless and \(r,u\) have units of inverse time, then \(\ln\!\frac{W}{r-uW}\) is dimensionless while \(rt\) is dimensionless, so \(Q\) is dimensionless. If one alternatively assigns a scale to \(W\), the same conclusion holds once a reference scale is absorbed.
- Limiting forms.
  - As \(W\to 0^\pm\): \(Q\sim \ln|W|-\ln|r| - r t\).
  - As \(W\to (r/u)^\mp\): \(Q\sim -\ln\big|r-uW\big| - r t + \text{const}\).
- Monotonicity of \(W\). On \((0,r/u)\) with \(r,u>0\), \(W\) grows monotonically to \(r/u\); on \((r/u,\infty)\), \(W\) decays monotonically to \(r/u\). The invariant remains constant on each interval separately.

5. Numerical verification (self-contained protocol)
Objective. Verify that the numerical drift \(\Delta Q \equiv \max_{0\le n\le N} |Q(W_n,t_n)-Q(W_0,0)|\) is limited by discretization/round-off and exhibits the expected step-order convergence.

Protocol.
- Time-stepper: fixed-step RK4 (or Dormand-Prince with tight tolerances).
- Parameters: e.g., \(r=0.15\), \(u=0.25\).
- Initial conditions: sample \(W_0\in(10^{-3},\, r/u-10^{-3})\) and \(W_0\in(r/u+10^{-3},\, 1-10^{-3})\) to test both sides of the middle pole.
- Time step and horizon: \(dt=10^{-3}\), \(N=10^5\) steps (double precision).

Acceptance gates.
- Double precision: \(\Delta Q \le 10^{-10}\) (RK45 with tight tolerances) or \(\Delta Q \le 10^{-8}\) (RK4 with \(dt\approx 10^{-3}\)).
- Single precision: \(\Delta Q \le 10^{-5}\).
- Convergence: halving \(dt\) reduces \(\Delta Q\) by a factor consistent with the order \(p\) of the scheme; a log-log fit of \(\Delta Q\) vs \(dt\) yields slope \(p\pm 0.2\).

Pseudocode (language-agnostic)
1) define F(W) = r·W − u·W²  
2) initialize t=0, W=W0, Q0 = ln(W/(r−uW)) − r·t  
3) for n in 1..N: advance (W,t) one step by RK4 with step dt  
4) compute Qn = ln(W/(r−uW)) − r·t and track max |Qn−Q0|  
5) report ΔQ and, if running a step-refinement, the observed convergence slope

Numerical notes. Trap underflow/overflow near the poles; reject steps that cross the singularity. The test is most transparent on \((0,r/u)\) for \(r,u>0\).

6. Why there is no naïve conserved “energy” here
If one guesses a per-site energy \(H(W,\dot W)=\tfrac12 \dot W^2 + V(W)\), then
\[
\frac{dH}{dt}=\dot W\big(\ddot W + V'(W)\big).
\]
In a first-order flow \(\dot W=F(W)\), \(\ddot W=F'(W)\dot W\). Hence
\[
\frac{dH}{dt}=\dot W\big(F'(W)\dot W + V'(W)\big),
\]
which is not generically zero unless \(\dot W\equiv 0\) or \(V'\) is tuned to cancel \(F'(W)\dot W\) pointwise in time—impossible for a potential that depends only on \(W\). Thus a time-independent Hamiltonian of this simple form is not conserved. The correct conserved quantity is the logarithmic first integral \(Q\) arising from autonomy/time-translation symmetry.

7. Discussion and scope
- The invariant \(Q\) is local (on-site). In spatially extended or coupled systems, \(Q\) is generally not conserved site-wise; instead, it serves as a per-node diagnostic for deviations induced by coupling/diffusion.
- The result is independent of implementation or discretization; it relies only on autonomy of the on-site law and standard calculus.
