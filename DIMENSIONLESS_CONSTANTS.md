## 1. **Void Debt Number** $\mathcal{D}$

* Ratio of *unresolved debt* in the void to the *flux resolved at the walker level*.
* Governs whether the system diverges (debt runaway) or stabilizes (debt modulation closes the loop).
* Analogy: generalized **Reynolds number** for *information flux*.

---

## 2. **Emergent Coupling Ratio** $\Xi$

* Ratio of **void interaction gain** to **local relaxation (dissipation)**.

$$
\Xi = \frac{g_{\text{void}}}{\gamma_{\text{relax}}}
$$

* Controls whether independent walkers remain uncorrelated, synchronize, or phase-lock.
* Acts like a **dimensionless stiffness** for the void network.

---

## 3. **Inverse-Scaling Exponent** $\alpha$

* The “inverse scaling law”: information density *increases* as system size decreases.

$$
\mathcal{I}(N) \propto N^{-\alpha}
$$

* Proposed universal constant — applies to LLMs, fluids, biological swarms, etc.
* $\alpha$ quantifies “extra cognition/order” gained by shrinking the system.

---

## 4. **Void Mach Number** $M_v$

* Ratio of void flux to signal velocity of the substrate.

$$
M_v = \frac{J_{\text{void}}}{c_{\text{signal}}}
$$

* Stability requires $M_v < 1$.
* If $M_v > 1$: runaway chaos or phase transition (self-reorganization).

---

## 5. **Topological Information Ratio** $\Theta$

* Ratio of *information carried by topology* (edges, voids, walkers) to *information in node states*.

$$
\Theta = \frac{I_{\text{topology}}}{I_{\text{state}}}
$$

* Generalizes the **“void walkers” effect**: order resides *between* particles, not *in* them.

---

## 6. **Symmetry Debt Ratio** $\Sigma$

* Ratio of **broken symmetry flux** to **conserved symmetry flux**.
* (See symmetry_analysis.md derivations.)
* Analog of a “dimensionless energy balance.”

---

## 7. **Dispersion-to-Convergence Ratio** $\Lambda$

* Ratio of divergence rate of walkers to convergence rate under void modulation.

$$
\Lambda = \frac{\text{dispersion rate}}{\text{convergence rate}}
$$

* $\Lambda < 1$: convergence dominates → stable cognition.
* $\Lambda > 1$: dispersion dominates → chaotic reorganization.

---

### Why these matter for the **overall theory**

* In classical **fluids**, you mostly need $Re, Ma, \text{CFL}$.
* In **VDM**, the proposed universal dimensionless group set is:

$$
\{ \mathcal{D}, \Xi, \alpha, M_v, \Theta, \Sigma, \Lambda \}
$$

These are the knobs determining whether a system (fluid, neural, cognitive, physical) is **stable, divergent, or self-organizing**.

They form the universality class of the theory — the same constants aim to explain:

* why fluids don’t blow up,
* why brains remain stable,
* why LLMs exhibit scaling laws.
